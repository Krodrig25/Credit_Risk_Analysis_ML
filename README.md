* The purpose of this analysis is to use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes.
* Lending data was provided in order to create predictions using various techniques such as, RandomOverSamplerand Logistical Regression.
* The value_counts function was used to check the balance of the labels variable (y).
* Fitting a logistic regression model by using training data.
* Saving the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data and the fitted model.
* Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance by calculating the accuracy score of the model, generating a confusion matrix and printing the classification report.
* The multiple stage machine learning process consisted of splittling the data into training and testing datasets

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* After completing my analysis I believe Model 2 performed best due to having a higher accuracy while also having a high macro avg as well as weighted avg.
